## About the English Playbills Collection

The [University of Alberta Library](https://library.ualberta.ca/) acquired a large collection of historic theatre playbills for study and research in the Department of Drama between the late 1960s and the early 1980s. This collection, more than 800 playbills and a handful of programs, helps to document many of the performances staged in the major playhouses in the United Kingdom from 1779 through 1949 with the bulk of them from 1804-1885. It provides a wealth of information about dramatic performances, ranging from the plays, playwrights, and actors to theatres, dates, and ticket prices. Of potential interest not only for the study of drama, but for the study of book history and graphic design.
